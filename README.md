The code is complete and functional. 

The code for matrix multiplication includes single-threaded (multiply) and multi-threaded (multiplyWithThreads) modes. In single-threaded mode, it performs standard matrix multiplication using nested loops. In multi-threaded mode, the task is divided among several threads, each executing threadMultiply, which multiplies a specific row range of the matrices and updates the shared matRes matrix. This parallel approach aims to leverage multiple CPU cores to speed up the computation.
